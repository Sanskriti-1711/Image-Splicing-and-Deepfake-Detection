**Image Splicing & DEepfake Detection**

<br>The development of user-friendly image manipulation software that is available at reasonable prices, has made the manipulation of such content easier than ever. In particular, some of these images are tampered with in such a way that it is impossible to detect even by humans. Three of the most common manipulations techniques are Copy-move: a specific region from the image is copy pasted within the same image. Splicing: a region from an authentic image is copied into a different image. Removal: an image region is removed and the removed part is then in-painted. In recent researches many deep learning techniques are used to detect forgery.
Deepfake is a technique for human image synthesis based on neural network tools like GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) or Auto Encoders etc. These tools super impose target images onto source videos using a deep learning technique and create a realistic looking deep fake video. We can use the limitation of the deep fake creation tools as a powerful way to distinguish between the pristine and deep fake videos. During the creation of the deep fake the current deep fake creation tools leaves some distinguishable artifacts in the frames which may not be visible to the human being but the trained neural networks can spot the changes. 

<br>*Objectives*
•	To develop, deploy and manage the training dataset and keep adding more sets to improve the efficiency of the system.
•	To study the working of CNN algorithm and trying to improve the performance of the algorithm for image splicing.
•	To discover the distorted truth of the deep fakes.
•	To provide a easy to use system for used to upload the video and distinguish whether the video is real or fake.
•	To develop a user-friendly GUI i.e a simple UI/UX where user can easily add the image and check the results.
